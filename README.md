# CMSC123 Lab 3: GroceryListArray

Following the design recipe, complete the following methods of GroceryListArray (don't forget to add methods to the GroceryList interface!):

1. `remove`
2. `markAsBought`
3. `totalQuantity` - returns the number of individual items in the GroceryList: e.g. 3 carrots + 5 tomatoes = 8
4. `reduceQuantity(String itemName, int quantity)` - if the given item is in the list, reduce its quantity as given. (If reducing quantity results in a quantity of zero or less, remove the item from the list.)
